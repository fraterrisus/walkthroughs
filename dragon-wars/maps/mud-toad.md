# Yellow Mud Toad

![map](mud-toad.svg)

A sinking, rotting, falling-apart old city, and yet one that marks a pivotal "mid-game" milestone. You find the Golden Boots here, which opens up a bunch of previously inaccessible locations.

## Exits

East: [Quag](dilmun.md) (26,08), which allows you to skip a Murk Tree fight.

South: [Quag](dilmun.md) (25,07), which doesn't.

There's also the hidden staircase down to [Lanac'toor's Laboratory](lanactoor.md), once you repair the statue at (07,10).

## Points of Interest

**The Town Healer (10,04):** Charges $4 per point of Health, just like everyone else.

**The [Souvenir Shop](../things-and-stuff.md#souvenir-shop) (13,06):** A source of **Dragon Stones**, **Bolts**, and **Arrows**. But the really interesting thing you can buy here is an **Ankh**, which you can give to the dragon in Lansk in exchange for the Dragon Gem. (No, there's no hint about this; you just have to guess.)

**The Cavern Tavern (12,14):** The barkeep knows a bunch of interesting gossip, but there's no one to recruit here. However, if you navigated [Phoebus](phoebus.md) correctly, Berengaria is waiting for you at (13,14). Disappointingly, this doesn't advance the plot any, but you do receive scrolls of *S:Rage of Mithras, S:Holy Aim, S:Armor of Light, S:Major Healing*, and *S:Summon Salamander*.

**The Statue of Lanac'toor (07,10):** Read paragraph #20. If you collect the four stone body parts from around Dilmun, you can use them here to repair the statue, which nets you 500 XP and opens the stairs down to [Lanac'toor's Laboratory](lanactoor.md).

**The Temple of the Mud Toad (04,13):** Read paragraph #17 to receive the quest to stop the Mud Leak. Once you seal up the leak, return here and read paragraph #113 to receive the **Golden Boots** (+2 AC, allows jumping).

**The Mud Leak (05,12):** Mud Toad is filling up with mud from this spring. You can stop that by casting *D:Create Wall* at the space between (06,12) and (05,12).

**The Crumbling Walls (14,06; 14,12):** Use *Climb* to pass through the rock slide.

**The Militia (02,02):** Climb through the walls at (14,12), then walk all the way around until you meet the militia (paragraph #32). Kill them and keep searching E until you find their treasure at (06,02). You find scrolls of *H:Water Summon* and *H:Reveal Glamour*, plus the **Barbed Flail** (1d30, +2 AC, STR 16), **Mountain Sword** (1d30, +3 AV, +2 AC, *H:Earth Summon*, requires *Mountain Lore 2*), and a pair of **Lucky Boots** (+1 AC).

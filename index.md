This repository contains walkthroughs that I've written for various computer role-playing games (CRPGs), mostly from the 1990s era of video gaming (i.e. my childhood). In the past I have posted these at various sites around the web, including GameFAQs, but the most up-to-date versions will always be kept here.

If you have questions about anything or spot an error, feel free to [file a Github Issue](https://github.com/fraterrisus/walkthroughs/issues) or get in touch. Happy gaming!

This repository contains walkthroughs that I've written for various computer role-playing games (CRPGs), mostly from the 1990s era of video gaming (i.e. my childhood). In the past I have posted these at various sites around the web, including GameFAQs, but the most up-to-date versions will always be kept here.

If you have questions about anything or spot an error, feel free to [file a Github Issue](https://github.com/fraterrisus/walkthroughs/issues) or get in touch. Happy gaming!

- [Bard's Tale 1](bards-tale-1): This is just my personal maps, not a full walkthrough.
- [Deathlord](deathlord): Highest-rated on GameFAQs before I stopped posting there.
- [Dragon Wars](dragon-wars): Rather exhaustive, based on code decompilation. (**New!** v3.0 available September 2023)
- [Pool of Radiance](pool-of-radiance/walkthrough.txt): An older effort; not quite complete but pretty close.
- [Wasteland](wasteland/): Complete and fairly comphrehensive.

# Magic

Spell scrolls, like all inventory items, are limited to 12 characters. The spell name in bold is what it's called in your spell list when you're casting a spell, but if there are scrolls that use abbreviations I've tried to include them in the table.

A reminder: all **Zap** and **Debuff** spells require an attack roll. If you "miss" with a Zap spell, it deals half damage.

*D:Scare* acts like a "debuff" spell in the sense that it requires an attack roll against an opposing group. However, if it's successful, it actually grants +2 AV to everyone in *the party* for the duration of combat, which is effective against *all* opponents, not just the ones you "hit" with the spell.

When you see a spell with a duration (i.e. "3hr / pt"), don't assume that an "hour" has any relationship to actual time. The game doesn't track time in any sort of consistent way, but a spell cast with more power will last longer than one cast with less.

Summoning spells, as the name implies, summon a creature to fill one of the slots in your party, so they don't work if you already have seven characters. They last 4 "hours" per point, and each spell conjures the same creature each time:

| Spell | Creature | HP | Dex | Armor | Weapon |
| ----- | -------- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Air Summon | Air Element | 12 | 12 | Air Armor: 8 | Air Talons: 1d10 |
| Earth Summon | Earth Elemnt | 15 | 14 | Earth Shield: 10 | Hammers: 1d20 |
| Water Summon | Water Elemnt | 25 | 15 | Water Wings: 11 | Waves: 1d20 | 
| Fire Summon | Fire Element | 35 | 18 | Fire Shield: 15 | Flames: 2d20 |
| Beast Call | Beast | 13 | 16 | Fur: 7 | Claws: 1d12 |
| Invoke Spirit | Spirit | 13 | 18 | Aura Shield: 12 | Ice Hands: 3d10 |
| Wood Spirit | Wood Spirit | 19 | 16 | Bark: 9 | Splinters: 1d12 |
| Summon Salamander | Salamander | 23 | 24 | Scales: 10 | Claws: 1d10 |

And no, you can't steal their equipment.

## Low Magic

All Low Magic spells can be found for free in the Purgatory magic shoppe. Low Magic scrolls appear in random additional places throughout the game as well, but nowhere else matters because if you ever need them again, Purgatory is never really all that far away.

| Spell | POW | Targets | Range | Type | Effect |
| ----- | :-: | :-----: | :---: | :--: | ------ |
| **Charm** | 3 | 1 | | Buff | Heal 1–4 hp, +1 AV for duration of battle |
| **Lesser Heal** | 2 | 1 | | Heal | Heal 1d4 hp |
| **Luck** | 3 | 1 | | Buff | +2 DV for duration of battle |
| **Mage Fire** | 2 | 1 | 30' | Zap | 1d8 dmg |
| **Disarm** | 4 | 1 | 30' | Debuff | Disarms target; not all monsters can be Disarmed |
| **Mage Light** | var. | | | Misc. | Light, 3hr / pt |

Consider getting your fighters Low Magic early in the game; having a 30' ranged attack is helpful.

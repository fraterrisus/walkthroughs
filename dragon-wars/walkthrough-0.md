### Acknowledgements

At this point, most of the information that I've included here is based on my own research, innumerable playthroughs, and decompiling the binary source files and picking through every bit of code at least once. However, before I did all that work, I leaned heavily on the following resources, and I'm indebted to the following folks for their work:

I used [**Andrew Schultz**'s walkthrough](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/appleii/575831-dragon-wars/faqs/7803) many times while first revisiting this game and writing this document. His walkthrough, and his autogenerated maps, are available at **GameFAQs.**

The [**Classic Gaming** website's page](http://www.classicgaming.cc/pc/dragonwars/) on *Dragon Wars* was also very helpful, and added information I hadn't read before on a few items and locations.

### Game Introduction

*Dragon Wars* is a classic CRPG that stands as the spiritual successor to the *Bard's Tale* series, and one of my favorites of all time. Some would call it "the missing *Bard's Tale IV*", although at this point that's a complete misnomer since the Bryan Fargo-led **inXile Entertainment** has released a very successful and very modern _BT4_ game. Highly recommended. But I digress.

I'm assuming you've read the game's manual and the reference card; they'll give you the background story and teach you how to move around and do stuff. It's worth noting (mostly because it didn't fit anywhere else) that many of the proper nouns in this game (Dilmun, Namtar, Nisir, Utnapishtim, etc.) are taken from Mesopotamian mythology and/or the Epic of Gilgamesh, which provides an interesting backdrop and helps explain the twists on the standard swords-and-sorcery epic-fantasy background story we're all accustomed to.

You'll also find a list of spells in the manual, but you won't need it because I've listed them all along with more information than is available there. You should also be aware that there are several red herrings and/or places where the manual is simply incorrect, whether intentional or not.

At the end of the manual is a list of paragraphs. You should be able to find a text file containing the paragraphs online, rather than having to squint at your poorly-scanned PDF manual. These help flesh out the story as you go, and give you some hints and other bits of direction. In the walkthrough I've marked the places where the game directs you to the paragraph list with `(pxxx)`, where `xxx` is the paragraph number. Careful, not all the paragraphs are real! But the fake ones are often funny and worth reading. I've listed out which ones are fake in the [end notes](#paragraphs), if you're curious.

### Managing Save Files

Assuming you're working with DOSBOX or some other PC emulator, *Dragon Wars* will keep its data in two files, `DATA1` and `DATA2`. All the data in `DATA2` is static, but `DATA1` is where your game is saved. So you can back up your save game at any point by copying the `DATA1` file to a different name. If you need to restore, quit the game first, then copy a backup file on top of `DATA1` and restart. The game itself only offers one save slot, so you can use this trick to have multiple parties, too.

Before you do anything else, make sure you have a backup copy of the game files, specifically `DATA1`, `DATA2`, and `DRAGON.COM`. Make another backup before you enter any new zone; I wound up with two dozen or so backups called `DATA1-slave-camp`, `DATA1-tars`, and so on.

If this is your first time playing the game, this is a good time to take the starter party and stroll around Purgatory for a while. Get used to the flow of combat and maybe get your ass kicked a couple of times. You can always start a new game and/or make new characters any time you want. When you're ready to start exploring Dilmun for real, come back here.

## Creating Characters

Unlike many other CRPGs, *Dragon Wars* doesn't force you to roll dice, or at least, doesn't force you to hit the space bar a million times while it randomly generates statistics for you until you get ones that are high enough to make you happy. Instead, you start the game with very pedestrian statistics and 50 **advancement points** (hereafter **AP**) to distribute as you wish among your attributes and skills. This is a far less frustrating way to create characters, and will be familiar to those of you who played *Wasteland*.

So let's talk about all the different ways you can spend AP. Throughout this section, numbers in [brackets] indicate the number of AP you need to spend to increase the attribute (or skill) by one level. If there are two numbers (mostly for magic skills), then the first number is the initial AP cost of level 1, and the second number is the AP cost of additional levels.

### Attributes

Attributes form the basic description of your character. Newly-generated characters start with a 10 in all primary attributes. All attributes start (conceptually) at zero and go up; higher numbers are always better.

**Primary attributes** are the ones you can increase by spending AP. Each one has a specific effect, as I list below, but more generally the game will sometimes have a character make "an attribute check", in which case it rolls a d20 and compares it to their attribute value. If you roll under your attribute value, you succeed; having a 20 STR means you always pass STR checks, so it can be helpful to have high attributes even if you don't normally do the thing that's primarily associated with it (i.e. melee combat). Attributes can also be **(U)sed** as if they're skills in some places; I'll point out places where this matters later on.

- [1 AP per pt] **Strength** **(STR)** is a required attribute for most melee weapons, grants bonus damage if it's high enough, and is handy for moving or knocking down things in your way.
- [2] **Dexterity (DEX)** is similarly a required attribute for most missile weapons, and grants bonus damage the same way. Dexterity also determines your **AV** and **DV**, which are arguably the two most important attributes in the game. Finally, DEX influences your initiative count during combat.
- [1] **Intelligence (INT)** is used in place of DEX when calculating the "AV" equivalent for a spell that requires an attack roll. See the section on [Magic](#magic) for more.
- [2] **Spirit (SPR)** sets the maximum value of **Power**, which is plenty of reason to have a lot of it (assuming you cast spells).
- [2] **Health (HP)** determines your maximum **Health** and **Stun**, similarly.

**Secondary attributes** are derived from your primary attributes and (often) your equipment; you can't change them directly with AP.

- **Power (POW)**: Equal to **SPR** x 2. This is your "mana" or "spell points" stat. Each spell you cast has a base Power cost. Some spells also allow you to spend more points; spending more Power gives you a more, well, *powerful* effect. Usually that means more damage or a longer duration; see the [spell descriptions](#magic) for more on this.
- **Stun**: *Dragon Wars* uses a two-tiered health system; Stun is separate from Health, but your maximum Stun is equal to your maximum **HP**. See the section on [Health and Stun](#health-and-stun).
- **Armor Class (AC)**: In *Dragon Wars*, a high AC reduces the damage you take *after* an opponent hits you. It is quite possible to have a high enough AC that a successful hit does zero damage. Unsurprisingly, putting on armor increases your AC. Some other items, including some weapons, will also modify your AC.
- **Attack Value (AV)**: Starts at **DEX** / 4 (round down). Increases your chance of hitting your opponent with weapons and spells. Also modified by weapons (usually up) and heavy armor (usually down).
- **Defense Value (DV)**: Also starts at **DEX** / 4 (round down), and doesn't get modified by much of anything, for good or for ill. Reduces the chance that an opponent hits you with an attack.

### Skills

One of the things that makes *Dragon Wars* such a classic game is that the designers allowed for multiple solutions to most puzzles in the game. Often you have the option to fight your way through, but you also often have the choice of one or more skills you can use, and in a pinch, sometimes just using an attribute is good enough as a substitute. So very few of these skills are "necessary" in the sense of being mandatory or irreplaceable.

This section just explains what each skill is for; check out [General Advice](#general-advice), below, for more specific opinions on whether you should take it or not.

- [1] **Arcane Lore, Cave Lore, Forest Lore, Mountain Lore, Town Lore**: Knowledge and understanding of various objects and situations.
- [2] **Bandage**: Outside of combat, using this skill will heal a character up to (ranks+10) *Health* for free. For my money, this is the most useful skill in the game.
- [1] **Climb**: Used to scale walls and mountains and climb down dark holes to dangerous places. Recommended.
- [1] **Fistfighting**: Like a weapon skill, but for your fists. Increases your effective AV *and* your damage output when unarmed.
- [2] **Hiding**: A general "be sneaky" skill.
- [2] **Lockpick**: Does what it says on the tin. Nearly mandatory if you want to beat the game.
- [1] **Pickpocket**: Lets you steal items from some unaware chump. 
- [1] **Swim**: Allows you to navigate difficult waters safely.
- [1] **Tracker**: Allows you to follow tracks you find in the ground.
- [1] **Bureaucracy**: Skill in oration, convincing people you're on their side, and navigating authority figures who want things from you.
- [10/2] **Druid Magic, High Magic, Sun Magic**: Allows access to magic schools. Increases effective AV when casting spells requiring an attack roll. Also sets the upper bound on POWER for variable-cost spells (2 * ranks).
- [5/2] **Low Magic**: Required before you can take any other magic skill.
- [â€”] **Merchant**: An easter egg; the designers added support for this skill and even wrote a few encounters that use it, but removed it from the "level up" screen for some reason. It's inaccessible unless you hex-edit your characters, so don't worry about trying to spend AP on it.
- [2] **Axes, Flails, Maces, Swords, Two-Handers, Bows, Crossbows, Thrown Weapons**: Weapon skills. Increases effective AV when using weapons of that class.

### General Advice

Here's some things to keep in mind when spending AP on your party, both at creation time and whenever you gain levels. Of course you should also feel free to do your own thing and ignore everything in this section. No offense taken.

**Party build:** You have seven slots but you can only create up to four characters. You can fill the other slots with NPCs you meet along the way or by casting summoning spells, or you can leave them empty if you want the challenge. I always play with persistent NPCs, since you can pick up three of them very quickly (especially if you cheat just a bit), and summoned creatures have a nasty habit of disappearing on you at inconvenient times.

Characters 1â€“4 in the marching order are the only ones who can melee, so generally you'll want four fighter types and three mage types behind them. Of the NPCs, **Ulrik** is an obvious choice for the front lines. **Louie** could swing either way (for a fighter, he's got a high SPR) but he doesn't start with any magic skills. **Valar** is already a great Sun mage. **Halifax** is a fighter, but he doesn't appear until super late in the game, and by the time you can pick him up you probably don't want to get rid of anyone else.

That being said, creating two fighters and two mages is probably your best bet. But that begs the question of which magic skills to take, and there's not really a single correct answer. Every school is useful, but every school can also be skipped at creation time. **High Magic** has the best early-game zap spells and there's no way to get access to it without building a PC with it, but you could live without it if you really wanted to. (The [Magic College](./walkthrough-1.md#magic-college) becomes unsolvable, though.) Valar comes with **Sun Magic** and a bunch of spells pre-loaded, so you don't need your own. But if you were going to double up on a school, this is the one to pick. **Druid Magic** is *required* in order to win the game, but because of that it's possible to pick it up in-game for free. You could let a strong fighter become a Druid mage instead of making one; I've had success letting Louie take this role.

Okay, fine, you're here for opinions, here's mine: For a fresh party, I almost always take *High Magic* and *Druid Magic*. My High Mage sits in slot 5 with a high DEX so I can give them the Gatlin Bow / Magic Quiver combo in the second half of the game. I pick up Valar early to round out the set, and Louie gets *Druid* from Enkidu once he's ready. Having two Druid mages is no bad thing (*D:Cure All*). But this is definitely not the only way to do it.

**Attributes:** Whoever's going to wrestle Enkidu for *Druid Magic* needs at least STR 16. Fighters will need at least STR 17 to use the good *Swords*. (If you have it early, consider taking a Greatsword from the Purgatory Arena.) A 20 is the minimum to use the good *Axes*, 22 gets you all the *Two-Handers*, and a few statues can only be moved with a 23 or better. If your STR is higher than the minimum for a melee weapon, you get +1 bonus damage for every five points above the requirement, so for example if you use a Hand Axe (min STR 5) with a 20 STR you deal 1d6+3 damage.

I think DEX 20 is generally a good idea, both for the +5 AV / DV and because it puts you solidly in the middle of the pack compared to the enemies you'll be fighting (for the sake of combat order). You'll hit first against most "scrubs" and probably go after most "big" enemies. Spending the 8 AP to get to DEX 24 isn't worth it, although DEX 21 plus the three point boost from the Universal God at the end of the game is nice before you plunge into the depths of the Nisir. Your spellcasters can start lower and work their way up later, and if you have a Druid mage in the back row it's not a terrible idea to follow the manual's suggestion and leave their DEX low so they can cast group-heal spells at the *end* of the round. (Don't also make them your *Bows* specialist, though; they'll want a high DEX for the damage bonus.)

INT is useful for mages that cast attack spells. Check out the [Magic](#magic) section and look for spells that require an "Attack Roll"; they use INT instead of DEX (and magic skill instead of weapon skill) to calculate the effective AV. Note that zap spells don't "miss", they just deal half damage on an unsuccessful attack roll, so don't sweat this too much. And don't bother spending any points on your fighters' INT.

**Skills:** There are lots of ways to build an effective party in *Dragon Wars*, but the most important piece of advice I have is to lean heavily into *Bandage*. Set aside one of your PCs to be your medic and don't let your fighters' HP stat outpace the medic's skill level by more than one or two ranks, and you'll dramatically reduce your dependence on magical healing. That, in turn, will reduce your dependence on Dragon Stones, and you'll thank me for that later. The downside is your medic won't have any other skills and might lag a bit behind the rest of the party in attributes, but it's worth it.

You also definitely want to take *Lockpick*: one rank is pretty much required, and three gets you access to almost everything. More than that increases your chance of being able to open locked chests, but there's only one place where there are consequences for failure. I recommend *Lockpick 3*.

I suggest one rank in:

- *Arcane Lore*: lets you use the Transportation Nexus intentionally, instead of randomly being teleported all over the place.
- *Climb*: very useful in a handful of places; makes getting into the Underworld easier, grants some extra loot and story.
- Either *Tracker* or *Bureaucracy*, but probably not both? Following tracks is only actually useful in one place (Tars), but that's pretty useful. *Bureaucracy* is helpful in the Slave Camp if you don't swim out of Purgatory, and gets you into the Lansk Undercity if you're bored. Strictly speaking, you don't need either.

Don't take:

- The other *Lore* skills. Broadly speaking, they give you a few extra bonuses throughout the game, but most of that is exposition in the form of paragraphs. Ulrik comes with *Cave Lore*, so you don't need it. *Forest Lore* reveals the Nature Axe and you need *Mountain Lore 2* to use the Mountain Sword, but I don't think either of those weapons are worth the AP. Any other uses are mentioned (and spoiled) in the walkthrough.
- *Pickpocket, Hiding*: Useful in a few places, but Louie comes with them, so you don't need to spend the AP. Even if you aren't going to pick up Louie for some reason, I wouldn't take these skills; there are alternate solutions.
- *Swim*: It's only required to get one bonus item, and Ulrik comes with *Swim* so you don't need to take it.

Let's talk **weapon skills**. You aren't required to have ranks in a weapon skill in order to use weapons of that class. However, your effective AV is a combination of your base AV (DEX / 4), the AV bonus of the weapon you're using, the AV penalty of whatever armor you're wearing, and however many ranks you have in the weapon skill. The AV that shows on your inventory screen doesn't take skill ranks into account, but they're there. So if you have DEX 20 (AV 5) and *Flails 3* and you're wielding a Runed Flail (+2 AV), the game shows your AV as 7 but you actually have an effective AV of 10.

Think of your AV as a one-for-one bonus added to your to-hit roll, and your opponent's DV as lowering it the same way. Given the combat mechanics, +1 AV is a 1-in-16 better chance to hit (6.25%), so +4 AV is a 25% bonus. Weapon skills are definitely more efficient at raising your AV than buying four points of DEX, but they lock you into a particular weapon class. Three things worth noting:

- Ulrik shows up with *Axes 3*, and heavy Axes often have AV penalties, so giving all your axes to Ulrik and increasing his skill might be worth your time.
- Personally, I think the Dragon Teeth (2d20, 60' range, +8 AV, +2 AC) are the best weapons in the game, and they're *Swords*. You won't get them until near the end, but once you do, I bet you won't use anything else. So throwing points in *Swords* doesn't hurt.
- The Gatlin Bow / Magic Quiver combo is incredibly deadly (theoretical maximum of **252 HP** plus high-DEX bonus per round), so having one of your back row specialize in *Bows* is nice.

There are plenty of good mid-game *Maces* and *Flails*, and if you're after raw damage, *Two-Handers* may be the way to go. But I found I swapped weapons around too much to limit myself by taking lots of ranks in one weapon skill. Also, there aren't enough *Crossbows* to be worthwhile, and the combat mechanics make *Thrown Weapons* too hard to use effectively.

*Fistfighting* basically counts as a weapon skill in terms of adding effective AV if you aren't holding a weapon, but unlike weapon skills it also increases your damage. With no ranks, you punch for 1d4; that goes up to a maximum of 7 ranks (1d6, 3d6, 5d6, 3d8, 5d8, 3d10, 3d12). You could make a pretty formidable martial artist by spending 15 AP on STR 20 and *Fistfighting 5*; 5â€“40 damage is better than all but the best late-game weapons, and you'll absolutely tear through Purgatory like that. The downside is that you can't Block without a weapon, and you'll never get the tasty AV or AC bonuses for using weapons. 

Finally, we discussed **magic skills** already, but I didn't mention skill ranks. Magic skills act like weapon skills when you're making magical attack rolls. Since a "miss" only deals half damage, a higher magical AV increases the overall effectiveness of your zap spells. More skill ranks also allow you to put higher amounts of POW into your variable-power spells. *Druid Magic* doesn't have any variable-power spells, but does have plenty of zap. Being able to cast higher-point *S:Inferno* is a big deal though, so I definitely suggest investing in a few ranks of *Sun Magic*.

### Sample Characters

Here's a sample set of starting characters that I took through the game. This will give you an idea of how I build my party, based on the advice above. You'll see them again in [Final Characters](#final-characters), towards the end of this guide.

  *Upgrades:* High 3, DEX 20+, Bows+, HP 15, SPR++

### NPCs

The game's NPCs are in a fixed place and always appear with the same stats and same level, no matter when you pick them up.

- **Ulrik**: Level 3, STR 20, DEX 17, INT 08, SPR 14, HP 15<br />

  *Equipment:* Long Mace, Large Shield, Chain Armor<br />
  *Upgrades:* I never bother taking him in the first place.

### Leveling Up

The *Dragon Wars* advancement system is pretty speedy at first â€“ you can reach level 4 without leaving Purgatory or really trying hard â€“ and quite slow later.

Experience is handed out equally to all party members who are alive (note: this includes Stunned) at the end of a battle. So chances are good that all four of your original party members will continue to level up at exactly the same time for the entire game.

Note that when you hit a new level, the game resets your XP counter to 0, so the number you really care about is "how much more until next level?" If you're going from level N to level N+1, the formula is (50 x N x N+1)... or you can just look on this table:

| Level |  XP  | Level |  XP  |
| :---: | :--: | :---: | :--: |
|   2   | 100  |   7   | 2100 |
|   3   | 300  |   8   | 2800 |
|   4   | 600  |   9   | 3600 |
|   5   | 1000 |  10   | 4500 |
|   6   | 1500 |  11   | 5500 |

12th level and all levels after that require the same +6600 xp to advance. So at least the curve stops getting steeper.

Every time you hit a new level, you get 2 AP to spend. Hit `(X)` and then pick a character to spend them. Note that you don't have to spend AP as soon as you get them; you can hold on to them (if you're saving up for a new Magic skill, for instance). Sometimes it's better to wait on that Health upgrade until your Bandage specialist gets another rank...

I'm fairly completionist, but when I start with a fresh party I always seem to finish the game at 12th or 13th level. That means you can expect to gain around 30 AP over the course of the game beyond what you start with, including the +5 Irkalla bonus. See the previous sections for more details on my suggested improvement paths for your PCs.

## Combat and General Information

### Combat Basics

The *Dragon Wars* combat system uses a turn-based combat system that will be familiar to fans of *Bard's Tale* or most other early CRPGs. On each turn you pick actions for your party, the computer picks actions for your enemies, and then it simulates the battle round. Action order is determined by your DEX + a random number 2â€“12; higher numbers go first. If your action executes at a point where it isn't useful, too bad!

Of the seven character slots in your party, only the first four can attack with melee weapons. Note that this is true even if your melee weapon has a ranged attack, like the Axe of Kalah, or you're using a thrown weapon, like the Boomerang; you must still be in the front four in order to `(A)ttack` with it. Also, it cuts both ways: only the first four slots can be attacked with melee, so your spellcasters are safe(ish) in the back line. Anyone (slots 1â€“7) can attack with missile weapons. Note that the weapon determines the *range*, but the ammunition (quiver) determines the *damage*.

At the start of each combat round, you're presented with the options to **(F)ight**, **(Q)uickly fight**, **(R)un**, or **(A)dvance**. In reverse order, **(A)dvance [-2 DV]** takes up your whole turn and moves the whole party 10' closer to the opponents. **(R)un [-2 DV]** directs every individual party member to try to flee from combat. **(Q)uickfight** gives you fewer options than **(F)ight**, but they both allow you to give individual orders to each character.

Those individual options are:

- **(A)ttack:** You'll be doing this a lot, obviously. If you *aren't* in Quickfight, you may get a secondary choice. Some missile weapons have the option to shoot more than one arrow. For melee weapons, you get to pick from:
  - **(A)ttack blow:** The default.
  - **(M)ighty blow [-4 AV]**: Adds 1d4 damage.
  - **(D)isarm [-3 AV, -1 DV]**: If successful, deals 1 HP damage and forces the target to drop their weapon. They lose a turn picking it back up.
  
- **(D)odge [+3 DV]**: Makes you harder to hit for the rest of the round.

- **(B)lock attack**: Cancels the first melee attack against you, but it's only available if you have a melee weapon readied. Not available in Quickfight.

- **(C)ast spell:** If you know more than one school of magic, you'll need to pick **(L)ow, (H)igh, (D)ruid,** or **(S)un**. Schools other than Low will then make you pick a spell type, **(C)ombat, (H)eal,** or **(M)isc**. Finally, you'll get a list of spells of that school and type to pick from; type the first letter of the spell name.

- **(U)se item [-2 DV]:** Dragon Stone, Healing Potion, or other magic item. Lots of things, including weapons, can be Used to great effect in combat; see the [Equipment](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/contribute/test_file_v3/4/things-and-stuff) page.

- **(N)ew weapon [-1 DV]:** Equip a different weapon.

- **(L)oad weapon [-1 DV]:** Equip a different ammunition item.

- **(R)un [-2 DV]:** Order this character to flee combat. There is no random component beyond your initiative roll, but some encounters will prevent you from running.

- **(M)ove** / **(A)head [-1 DV]** or **(B)ehind [+1 DV]**: Shuffles the marching order in the middle of a turn. A character who moves Ahead swaps with the character in front of them, and vice versa. Not available in Quickfight.

At any time while giving individual orders, you can press ESC to back out of a menu or skip back to a previous player. You can even back all the way out to the turn menu and change your mind on Fight or Quickfight or Run. After you've given an order to every party member, you get a chance to confirm before executing the actions.

**Targeting Groups:** Once you've chosen an action, if there are multiple groups of enemies, you get to pick which group you want to attack. If, when your turn comes up in the initiative order, the group you're attacking is out of range or no longer has any live opponents, then your action is wasted. So execution order (and therefore DEX) matters!

**Attack Rolls:** When a combatant attacks, the game rolls 1d16+2. A minimum roll (3) always hits and a maximum roll (18) always misses. Beyond that, the target is 13; you hit if you roll **equal or below** that, so lower numbers are better. Odds favor the attacker slightly: all other things being equal, you have a 68.75% (11 out of 16) chance of succeeding on any given attack. (Note that if you get multiple attacks, each one is rolled separately.)

Of course, "all other things" are basically *never* equal. The target number is increased (i.e. making it easier to hit the opponent) by your AV (DEX/4, plus equipment modifiers) and the number of ranks you have in the appropriate weapon skill (or *Fistfighting*, if you're unarmed). Likewise, the target number is decreased by the target's DV, making them harder to hit. When you're on defense it works the same way, using the monster's DEX and AV and your DV.

(If you're casting a spell that requires an attack roll, it works the same way, but you use INT/4 to calculate your "magic AV", you don't get equipment modifiers, and you get to add ranks in your magic skill. The opponent's DV is the same.)

The game counts up the number of hits and rolls the damage die that many times. Unarmed attacks do 1d4 of punching damage, but *Fistfighting* can increase that.

If your weapon has a skill or attribute requirement, you get +1 bonus damage for every 5 ranks that you exceed the requirement (round down). This is true regardless of whether the weapon requires STR, DEX, or Mountain Lore. If you take *seven* ranks of Mountain Lore in order to get +1 damage from the Mountain Sword I will personally come to your house and give you a wedgie. Monsters don't have weapon skills.

If you hit with Mighty Attack, roll a bonus 1d4. Monsters have an similar attack type, but instead of dealing bonus damage, it ignores your armor; see below.

Mighty damage and Skill bonus damage are rolled/calculated once, but they are applied to *each attack that hits.* One hit for 3d4 is different than three hits for 1d4 each, because the latter gets three bonuses and the former only gets one. So maybe your archer/mage should have a high DEX after all; the Gatlin Bow requires DEX 10, and +2 damage *per arrow* is pretty significant when you hit 20-30 times per attack.

When you're on defense, your armor reduces the damage you take. 1 point of AC reduces the damage *per attack* by 1, so if you've got AC 20 then a monster has to deal at least 20 damage before you even feel it. However, some monsters have a Mighty Attack that ignores armor.

### Health and Stun

The most novel aspect of combat in *Dragon Wars* is the multi-tier health system. Everyone in your party has two sets of hit points, Health (the orange bar) and Stun (the green bar). (Your enemies only have Health; they can't be Stunned, and therefore can't return to combat once they're knocked out.) In general, everything deals twice as much impact on Stun as it does on Health, which is to say that you are far more likely to run out of Stun than you are to run out of Health. If either value hits 0, you become incapacitated ('stunned' or 'dead', respectively). Characters that are incapacitated at the end of the combat round are shuffled to the end of the marching order; if you're not in combat, they stay where you put them.

Dead characters cannot practically be resurrected. It is literally *possible* to do, but so annoying as to never be worth your time. You're better off restoring from your last save game. If you really want to know, there are directions down at the bottom of this section.

After combat ends, all non-Dead characters automatically heal Stun up to full. Health damage is permanent until you heal it. Between combats, the best way to restore Health points is to `(U)se` the *Bandage* skill. *Bandage* always works, takes no time (i.e. you can't be interrupted in the middle of healing your whole party even though it requires multiple actions), and always brings you up to (10+skill) Health. This is why it's important for your healer to have a skill value that's (nearly) high enough to heal your fighters. You'll pretty quickly develop the muscle memory of typing `(U)se (#) (S)kill (A)bility (B)andage` over and over. If you're clever when building your party and don't give your healer any other Ability skills (or any other skills at all), you can save keypresses.

During combat, the only way to heal is through magic. Healing spells work so long as you have living casters with Power. You can also `(U)se` healing potions, of which you'll find a couple along the way. Healing magic restores Stun as well as Health, and will revive a Stunned character. It is totally possible (and often a good idea) to cast a healing spell on a character who *might* become Stunned during a round. If they are Stunned early in the round, the healing spell will revive them later, and they won't get shuffled to the bottom of the marching order at the end of the round if they're still standing. This is why it's not a bad idea to give your Druid a low DEX: they will act towards the end of the round, and *D:Cure All* is pretty awesome.

Beware of the effects of magical healing on Health and Stun. As I said before, Stun is affected twice as much as Health, and that's true in both directions. If you're in a long, drawn-out battle, it's quite possible to run out of Stun a couple of times and find yourself dipping into the single digits of Health even after healing back up to near-full Stun. This is how characters die. Keep an eye on that orange bar.

Don't ignore the party reshuffling aspect of Stunned characters. There's not much worse than having your primary healer suddenly find themselves in the front line taking melee hits when you really need them to revive a Stunned fighter who's now in slot 7. Wearing armor doesn't affect a mage's ability to cast spells, so I strongly suggest letting your fighters' cast-off armor trickle down to your spellcasters to boost their AC. It can take a while to shuffle a downed fighter back into the front lines, and you'll want to be very careful how you manage your combat actions when this happens.

If you find you have to reorder your party in combat (and you will), beware of casting healing spells at the same time. When you choose a party member on which to target the heal, you are actually selecting a *slot*, not a *person*. If two PCs swap places before the spell is cast, it will land on whoever is newly occupying that slot. Consider the relative DEX scores of the caster and the recipient when trying to heal a moving target, and cross your fingers.

#### Resurrecting Dead Characters

If you're reading this section, then one of three things had better be true:

1. You're a completionist, and you're reading my walkthrough from cover to cover. Welcome, friend.
2. You heard me complaining earlier about how dumb this process is, and you want to know just *how* dumb.
3. One of your PCs died **and** you screwed up your save files such that you can't restore from a previous save.

If it's that last one, I'm going to ask you to seriously consider starting the game over from scratch before we proceed. Regardless, you're going to have to slog through another few paragraphs describing how terrible this process is before I tell you the actual answer. I have literally only ever gone through this process for the purposes of documenting how to do it; I was already in the Necropolis and someone died from a Ghoul bite, so I figured I'd try it out.

Let's start with location. In order to resurrect a dead character you have to get to the [Necropolis](./walkthrough-1.md#all-we-wanna-do-is-eat-your-brains-the-necropolis). Technically, the Well of Souls is in the Underworld, not the Necropolis, but the building that houses it is immune to *D:Soften Stone*, so there's no access without going through the Necropolis.

Of course, the only way to get to the Necropolis is by boat. I suppose you don't *have* to have beaten Ugly and his crew and taken his boat from him; you could just bribe him to take you there. Which is good, because that's a really hard battle even with a full party, and you're likely to lose somebody in that fight.

If you don't happen to be on one of the Eastern Isles already, you have to pick up the boat at [Smuggler's Cove](./walkthrough-1.md#smugglers-blues-smugglers-cove). Quag is infested with Murk Trees, and they're potentially deadly no matter how good your AC is. You have to fight off at least one group of them to get to the Cove, and there's a non-zero chance that you lose *another* PC in that fight.

Even if you've already cleared the Necropolis once and you're coming back just to use the Well of Souls, you still have to fight off two really annoying Guardians. And, again, no using *D:Soften Stone* to skip the fights.

And if for some reason you don't currently have *Arcane Lore* in your party â€” say, your mage with that skill is the one who died â€” you won't be able to use the Nexus, so it's even harder to get to Quag, **and** you'll need it to use the Well of Souls in the first place, so you're screwed anyway. You might as well go pick up Halifax in Freeport; at least he comes with *Arcane Lore.*

*Or just reload your damn game.*

Still with me? Okay, here we go:

- Get yourself to the Necropolis.
- Enter the building, fight off both Guardians, and exit the foyer.
- Go straight S through a door, then 2W 1N through another door, then 1W. Those stairs take you down to the Underworld.
- Follow the corridor all the way around until you can see a pit.
- There's a corner with a missing guardrail. Step there and `(U)se` *Arcane Lore.* Toss a DEAD body into the pit (p128) and it will be returned to you alive but Stunned and with 1 HP.
- Then `(U)se` *Bandage* to recover Health.
- Now you have to get out of here; by going to the Underworld and back, the Necropolis map will reset, and the walls are immune to *D:Soften Stone.* So you either have to go back out through the Guardians again or through the spider hallway. Fortunately, the spider hallway doesn't reset, so if you've been here before that's the better choice.

### Combat Strategies

The #1 problem that you will be faced with while in combat â€” well, okay, aside from actually just staying alive and unstunned â€” is how to close into melee range with your opponents. The computer, I'm sorry to say, cheats: it knows whether or not you've given the **(A)dvance** order to your party before it assigns orders to the monsters, and if it behooves the monsters to sit and wait for you to advance, they will.

Here's a particular example: one group of monsters is 20' away from you. If you **(A)dvance**, they will choose **(F)ight** actions. If you go first, you step into melee range, and they get free hits. On the other hand, if you stand your ground and give **(F)ight** actions, there's a chance that they will **(A)dvance** first, and then you get free hits. This is almost always the right idea, even at the cost of a few wasted swings at monsters that are too far away. The exception is if you're fighting multiple groups, and the distant group has a ranged attack, and you need to close to a certain distance in order to hit them with your ranged attack and/or spells.

I've tried to lay out useful strategies for some of the harder encounters in the walkthrough. But mostly you'll just figure this stuff out by the time you leave Purgatory.

One additional note that didn't fit anywhere else: when enemies feel like they're overpowered â€” say, because you're playing through a fifth time and your PCs are 20th level â€” they will sometimes try to run away, and sometimes try to call for help. This especially happens with the various types of Guards you'll run into. I'm not totally sure how this affects your XP, but you definitely earn some for enemies that run away.

**Weapon Choice:** I find thrown weapons to be pretty useless. They work like melee weapons with range, which is to say, you have to be in the front rank to use them. (I'm convinced this is a bug caused by an obscure 'greater-or-equal' instead of 'greater than' error.) However, most thrown weapons are single-use, so once you **(A)ttack**, you have no equipped weapon anymore, and you have to waste your next turn readying a **(N)ew** weapon. The Boomerang, at least, comes in a stack of 10 and does reasonable damage. The Trident has unlimited uses and comes back every time you throw it, but you find it around the same time as the Dragon's Teeth, which are better in just about every way.

In the early game, missile weapons are kind of nice because you can get additional attacks from your back row, but managing an inventory full of arrows gets annoying fast. Most quivers don't do very much damage, although there's a bug you can exploit to get copies of the better ones. On the other hand, the Gatlin Bow / Magic Quiver combination is amazingly deadly; you'll likely do more damage with that combo than any melee weapon, all the way through the end of the game. My advice is to get bows for your back row as soon as possible (the Purgatory Arena, for example). Stop collecting arrows whenever you get sick of managing them, you find that your mages have better things to do, or you just have better things to do with the inventory slots. But don't get rid of the bows; spellcasting also uses your AV, so keeping a high-AV weapon (Ruby Dagger +3, Magic Bow +4) around is still a good idea.

Melee weapons with a ranged attack are incredibly useful. You don't have to do anything special to activate the ranged attack; simply **(A)ttack** a group of enemies that is more than 10' away (but hopefully closer than the maximum range of your melee weapon) and you will attack as normal. Note that some reach weapons do different damage at distance than they do at 10'; see the [weapon tables](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/contribute/test_file_v3/4/things-and-stuff#weapons). I found that I often prioritized having 'reach' over a weapon that did more damage at 10'. You may have different preferences or combat styles.

Also remember that some armor and weapons have additional magical actions that can be useful in combat. **(U)sing** the weapon during a combat round will activate the spell on your turn. For example, if you use the Druid's Mace in combat, it casts *D:Cure All*, which coincidentally is the best group-heal spell in the game.

**Attack Styles:** I mostly just use normal attacks. All other things being equal, 1 point of AV translates into a 6.25% chance to hit, so Mighty Attack is a 25% penalty for +1d4 damage (average 2.5 HP), which probably isn't worth it â€“ if you've got a high-enough AV that you're going to hit even at -4, you're also likely doing enough damage that the bonus doesn't matter. And since you can't see your opponent's Health, you don't really have enough information to know when it might be useful.

Disarm is handy in one or two places that I've mentioned in the walkthrough. A successful Disarm deals 1 HP, but some monsters are immune and there's basically no way to tell which ones that is or isn't true â€” it will look like your Disarm works, but behind the scenes the monster just shrugs it off.

Similarly, Block is useful in a few places against really powerful single opponents (like Namtar), if you're facing opponents with really high AC, or if a mage winds up in the front four while you shuffle a stunned fighter back up. The nice thing is that it always works (on the first attack), so long as you're carrying a melee weapon.

**Moving:** Here's a pro tip that can help you shuffle your party quickly during a combat turn. You already know that you assign actions from front (slot 1) to back (slot 7, at most). When you tell a character to Move, their *destination slot* is immediately memorized. But, of course, character actions are only *resolved* during the combat turn, and that mostly happens due to DEX ordering.

Let's say your party is Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eric, Frank, and Grace, arranged in slots 1-7 respectively. If you tell Dave to Move Behind, his ultimate destination is slot 5. Very little will change this. When Dave's turn comes up in the order, he will swap with whoever is in slot 5. Maybe that's still Eric, or maybe not, but regardless, Dave will move to slot 5, *even if he isn't still in slot 4.*

Now, if you *also* told Eric to Move Behind, then his destination is slot 6. Eventually (assuming everyone gets to move and no one becomes incapacitated), the result is that Frank will (eventually) wind up all the way forward in slot 4, followed by Dave, then Eric. You can use this trick to propel someone from rank 7 to rank 1 in one turn, if you're willing to spend your entire turn having everyone in the party Move Behind.

Things get more complicated if you mix moving Ahead and Behind, though. Given the original party order, if you tell Charlie to Move Behind and Eric to Move Ahead, what happens? Well, it depends on which order Charlie and Eric go; you might wind up Dave-Eric-Charlie, or you might wind up Eric-Charlie-Dave. I don't recommend trying to play with this one; the results are sometimes hilarious (note: not actually hilarious).

### Game Mechanics

**Lock picking:** When you come across a locked chest, you'll want to pick your best *Lockpick* to try to open it. Chests have a difficulty rating. If your skill level is below the difficulty, you can't open the chest. If it's equal, you have a 50% chance of opening the lock. That goes up to 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and 95% if your skill level is higher than the lock's difficulty. It tops out at 95%, so there's always a chance you might fail, but trying again is free.

Most of the time, locked doors are all-or-nothing.

### Dealing With Loot

The first thing you need to know about *Dragon Wars* is that there is no random loot. The location of every object that you can pick up is pre-programmed and never changes. Combats do not drop random objects (although Guards are likely to drop a few coins). I admit this reduces the replayability of the game a bit, but it also makes writing a walkthrough *much* easier.

Like many CRPGs of the era, the game's economy is kind of broken. Money is basically never an issue. Sure, you start in Purgatory as a bunch of penniless paupers, but who cares? The Arena will give you everything you need to get started. From then on you should have no problems keeping yourself well-funded. I ended the game with almost $60,000. Inventory management becomes a huge headache if you try to keep and sell everything. If you find yourself with more than $10,000 in cash, you should feel free to start dropping stuff instead of hanging onto it to sell.

You also have the option of not picking up things in the first place. When presented with a chest, if you leave some things behind, they are likely to stay there and you can come back for them later (at least until you leave the map). Don't worry about accidentally "leaving" a chest in order to shuffle your inventory around; just hit ESC once or twice and the chest should come back. There are a few exceptions to this rule, which I've tried to note when I found them.

The game generally does a nice job at providing equipment upgrades at the right time, instead of forcing you to buy them. You'll farm enough gold to buy your first round of equipment in Purgatory, but it's optional. From then you may not buy another piece of armor or weaponry until Freeport, which is almost 2/3 of the way through the game.

When you do go to sell stuff, you can largely sell anything anywhere for half of its purchase price. The useful places to sell things are the Purgatory Black Market, the Lansk Undercity shops, the Byzanople Siege Camp Black Market, and the Mud Toad souvenir shop. Several items have no purpose beyond their resale value; when in doubt, see the list of [Unique Items](#unique-items). Keep in mind that selling something is similar to discarding it â€“ once it leaves your inventory, it's gone. You can't buy unique items back from the shop you sold them to.

All of the hint guides basically tell you to horde Dragon Stones as if they're the most precious resource on Oceana. I find this advice *ridiculous,* but that may be because I put so many points into *Bandage* that I'm not as reliant on magical healing. But because there are several spots where you can regenerate Power without using a Dragon Stone, I really only need them for deep dungeon dives. Also, you'll find Dragon Stones all over the place, and even if you don't, most of the good shops have them for sale and money will never really be an issue. So use a Stone whenever you want and don't worry about stuffing your mages' inventory full of them. Make sure you always have a handful, and if you can't remember where the last stash was, buy a few more.

### Weird Stuff

Some random notes I've collected on my journeys through Dilmun...

I mentioned this already under [Health and Stun](#health-and-stun), but I find the "target a slot, not a party member" thing to be very strange and also very annoying. "Hey, *you're* not Thog!"

There are a few maps that allow you to use *D:Soften Stone* to pass through the ostensible "outer" walls of the map. Sometimes (Purgatory, Tars) this lets you into a blank spot in the middle of the map, and sometimes (the Kingshome dungeon, Dwarf Clan Hall, the +5 AP leap of faith in the Underworld) you can go wandering so far off-course that the automap stops drawing anything. If you keep moving far enough in one direction, the map will eventually wrap around and you'll find the opposite edge of the map, like Columbus trying to find India. My guess is that happens at 256 steps but I haven't bothered to count. You rarely find anything interesting out there, so this is more of a curiosity than anything.

If you're running around inside the outer walls of Purgatory, and you encounter some King's Guard, and you run away, the game dumps you back at the start square as if you've been "captured" again.

When you see a low wooden fence, you can cast *D:Soften Stone* on it. The fence goes away, but nothing else changes. (If you weren't able to move through/past the fence before, you still can't.)

Game maps reset whenever you leave them... mostly. In particular this means that any wall that you *Soften* regenerates if you leave and come back, and most "fixed" encounter points will reset as well. But I said "mostly"; certain fixed encounters are "unique" and you only get to do them once (Humbaba, Mystalvision, etc.) And once you plug the leak (or repair the statue of Lanac'toor) in Mud Toad, it stays plugged. Starting a new game, of course, resets everything about the game state (but not about your [characters](#final-notes)).

Speaking of unique encounters that shouldn't reset, *Dragon Wars* **mostly** does a good job maintaining continuity. But occasionally things happen that don't make sense; events repeat themselves, dead people come back to life, etc. I guess there's only so much you can do with "global state" in games from this era. One example: if you win the battle in Kingshome, then go back to Phoebus, Buck Ironhead is still there and you can still enlist in the army. You're sent to the Siege Camp again, which is empty.

I should note, though, that this is also an example of how the developers wrote in multiple solutions to almost everything, including the problem of navigating between islands. You can "enlist" in Phoebus and get transported to King's as many times as you want, so if you find yourself without *Arcane Lore* (so you can't use the Nexus), you can still get there. The ferry between Lansk and the Old Dock can get expensive, but also solves this problem.

There are lots of duplicated items. Most of the time, they're identical, but sometimes they aren't:

- The price of several items varies for no reason I can fathom. If you buy Plate Armor in a shop, it costs $3100; the suit you find in the Mystic Wood sells for $1550, which makes sense. But the suit you find in Phoebus sells for $1500. They're otherwise identical. There are two sets of Dragon Plate that do the same thing. Large Shields purchased in Freeport cost 1/10 what they do everywhere else. (Market inefficiencies?) The spell scrolls that Nergal gives you can't be sold, even though other copies of the same scroll can.
- The Boomerang you find in Kingshome does much more damage (2â€“20 at 60') than the one you find on the second Guard Bridge (1â€“12 at 50'). The Kingshome "Pole Arm" (1â€“20, +2 AV) is a better weapon than the standard "Polearm" (1â€“10, +1 AV); I like to think that Namtar's weaponsmiths invented a better model with a space in the middle. Likewise the dwarves seem to have developed a Bomb (2d30) with twice the explosive power as the ones you find in the Underworld (1d30). However, the Slave Camp "Handaxe" and the standard "Hand Axe" are identical, as are the Kingshome "Magic Axe" and the "MagicAxe" found in the Byzanople crypt.
- Several scrolls have clones with different names to fit the 12-character limitation on item names. The "Insct.Plague" scroll teaches you the same spell as "Insect Plag.", but one of them sells for more money than the other for no apparent reason. Similarly, you'll find both "Bolt" and "Bolts".

While we're on the subject of inventory, there are a handful of items that inexplicably have spells attached to them, but they come with no charges. Did you somehow figure out that the Magic Chain you get in the Necropolis can cast *M:Zak's Speed*? Of course not. Well, it can, but only if you cast *S:Charger* on it first.

- Bomb (Magan Underworld): *M:Zak's Speed*
- Magic Chain (Necropolis): *M:Zak's Speed*
- Mage Ring (Kingshome Dungeon): *D:Whirl Wind* â€” note that the Magic Ring (Phoebus Dungeon) *does* cast this spell successfully
- Branches (Snake Pit): *D:Beast Call*

Final note on inventory: keep an eye out throughout this document for **Easter Eggs**.Â In my exploration of the the decompiled data files I found a number of references to items, encounters, skills, spells, etc. that can't actually be found in the game. I've included their stats just for the sake of completeness, and your entertainment.

After you get Ugly's boat, the teleporter in the Necropolis at the end of the spider hallway works differently depending on what kind of computer you're using to play the game. On the PC, it teleports you back to your boat. On the Apple, it teleports you to somewhere in Dilmun and ghost-sails the boat back to Smuggler's Cove.

The Dead Bolt does some serious damage (1d20), but it also has a very odd feature: you can cast *S:Charger* on it to refill it as if it were a magic item. It's the only quiver that this works on. Internally it has similar bits set to the Magic Quiver, but that one 'recharges itself'.

In Lanac'toor's Lab, if you take the stairs back up to Mud Toad, the statue of Lanac'toor is mysteriously broken again. As soon as you take any move (including checking the automap or turning), the statue reforms. This one feels to me like a display bug in the engine.

The code that runs when you leave a map usually uses your current location as well as your current facing to determine where to send you. In most places this works the way you'd think, but the developers took a few shortcuts and made some "well it's gotta do *something*"-type decisions. For instance, if you leave the Bridge of Exiles to the E, you end up on King's Isle, and if you leave to the W, you end up on the Snake Pit side. But what happens if you leave to the N? You're on a bridge; there's only water on the Dilmun map to the N of here. So they drop you on the same place as if you'd left to the E or W. The problem, of course, is that if you exit to the N on the E side, you wind up on a fight with a bunch of Goblins. Run away from that fight while facing S... and you turn around and run into the water. There's a few other instances like this.

Purgatory's got two of them; exit to the N (which, to be honest, there's not really any reason to ever do) and you get dropped in Dilmun. Turn around... and Purgatory isn't behind you, it's 2W of you. (I'm betting this one's a bug that never got QA'd, because who leaves Purgatory to the *north*?) An even better trick: take the secret door out, walk all the way around to the NE corner, and exit to the E. The game doesn't differentiate between walking E and swimming E, so you still wind up on the south side of Purgatory Bay near the refresh pool.

If you're playing on a PC, the item beneath the statue on the Old Dock is a PS/2. If you're playing on an Apple emulator, it's a IIgs. It does the same thing either way, including granting +4 AC if you equip it.

## Final Notes

Now that you've beaten Namtar â€“ actually, you can do this any time you want â€“ you can start over by reloading the game and indicating at the prompt that you want to `(B)egin` a new game instead of `(C)ontinuing` your old one. You keep your party as-is, including stats, spells, and any NPCs you've picked up, but (as happens when you get dumped into Purgatory) not including any of your equipment.

The most notable use for this "cheat" is recycling the +5 AP [Irkalla](./walkthrough-1.md#magan-underworld-highlights) bonus. All you have to do is start the game, visit the Underworld, find Irkalla's Realm, and step over the rail. Repeat that as often as you like. It's a good way to get Magic skills for your front line fighters; one trip gets a skill point in Low Magic, two trips equals your first skill point in Sun Magic, and seven high-point *S:Infernos* will go a long way (although wow is it a pain to haul out to the Necropolis to get it every time you mint a new Sun mage). Just sayin'.

Otherwise, every map (mostly) resets every time you leave it, so the only other thing that starting a new game does is reset all the items and some of the "unique" encounters (Humbaba, Mog, Kingshome/Siege Camp, Necropolis, etc). If you drop a unique quest item, though, this is your only choice.

The lowest-level characters with which I've ever beaten the game (without multiple Irkalla runs) were 12th level. Experience level, of course, is basically irrelevant to the game except as a means for gaining AP, so you could alternately call those 77 AP $(50 + 5 + 2 \cdot (12-1))$ characters.

### Paragraphs

The paragraph booklet was a common technique for expounding on the story without filling up the game's data files with lots of text... although *Dragon Wars* has plenty of that. In the days where photocopiers were expensive and digitizing manuals to publish them online wasn't an option, a book of paragraphs also served as something of a copy-protection mechanism.

But the game designers also wanted to make sure you didn't just read the paragraphs from start to finish and learn all the clues you'd need to beat the game. So they included a bunch of fake paragraphs. Out of the 147 paragraphs in the booklet, here's a list of all the fakes; anything I don't mention here is actually referred to in the game somewhere.

- \#2: All the "vampire lord" paragraphs are fake.
- \#8: Trying to make you doubt whether hiding in the Morgue sacks will work.
- \#12: Har har har.
- \#31: No pirates, except for Ugly and his crew.
- \#40: This could have shown up in the Nisir and it wouldn't have been out of place.
- \#44: You don't fix Mud Toad with paint.
- \#54: Lanac'toor is never revived.
- \#78: There's no reason this couldn't show up in the Snake Pit, but it doesn't.
- \#95: Mog's an asshole, but you're not digging a tunnel.
- \#112: There is no desert, there is no live volcano, and the riches in Dragon Valley are definitely not "free for the t\aking".
- \#116: There is no blind juggler, although the rest is more or less accurate.
- \#129: An underground resistance would be pretty cool, if it actually existed.
- \#132: Still no vampire lords.
- \#133: No trolls in this game, either.
- \#135: Namtar may be evil, but he's not a James Bond villan.
- \#136: Complete gibberish.
- \#139: I definitely want an airship. Alas.
- \#140: More like a prelude to the game, or something you might read while hiking across Forlorn in the early game.
- \#147: Definitely could be read out at the entrance to Dragon Valley, but there's no reference there.

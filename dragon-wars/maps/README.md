# Maps

This directory contains annotated SVG maps of every board in the game along with Markdown files describing all of the various items, monsters, and points of interest. There's more detail here than there is in the [walkthrough](../walkthrough.md), including a bunch of easter eggs and other random tidbits that aren't necessarily relevant. They're probably more useful if you're going through the game multiple times and want the "completionist" experience.

# Dilmun

![map](dilmun.svg)

As a warning, you can't cast *D:Create Wall* here, and *D:Soften Stone* probably won't get you anywhere. Just in case you were tempted to try. Also, the map wraps, not that you can actually go sailing over the water.

**Ambush (20,26):** The first time you step on this square, you're subdued by guards and thrown in the [Kingshome Dungeon](kingshome-dungeon.md). This is also where the ferry master from the Snake Pit drops you, which may very well trigger the ambush if you haven't already.

The **[Old Dock](old-dock.md) (14,17)** can be used to travel to the Lansk Undercity or the Pilgrim Dock.

**More Goblins (08,18):** These guys are just insult to injury; the fight regenerates, so if you try to exit the Bridge of Exiles to the E you hit them immediately.

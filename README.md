# README

This repository contains walkthroughs that I've written for various computer role-playing games (CRPGs), mostly from the 1990s era of video gaming (i.e. my childhood). In the past I have posted these at various sites around the web, including GameFAQs, but the most up-to-date versions will always be kept here.

Feel free to get in touch if you spot an error or have questions about anything, and happy gaming!

- [Bard's Tale 1](bards-tale-1/): This is just my personal maps, not a full walkthrough.
- [Deathlord](deathlord/walkthrough-0.md): Highest-rated on GameFAQs before I stopped posting there.
- [Dragon Wars](dragon-wars): Rather exhaustive, based on code decompilation. (**New!** v3.0 available September 2023)
- [Pool of Radiance](pool-of-radiance/walkthrough.txt): An older effort; not quite complete but pretty close.
- [Wasteland](wasteland/walkthrough.txt): Complete and fairly comphrehensive.

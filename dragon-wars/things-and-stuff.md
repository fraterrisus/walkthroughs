# Yet Another Dragon Wars Walkthrough

## Weapons

All weapons conflict with each other, i.e. you can't wield an axe and a flail simultaneously, nor can you wield a sword and a crossbow. *Most* weapons don't conflict with shields.

Bows, like Two-handers, conflict with Full Shields but not regular Shields.

| Tri-Cross    |   600    |      |  30'  |  15  |  +1  | can fire x1 or x3       |

### Guns
No, there aren't actually any guns in *Dragon Wars*; this is an easter egg. There's no corresponding weapon skill, either. But there sure is an "item type" in the code for it, along with one for "Ammo Clips" (as distinct from Ammunition, below).

### Ammunition

The item conflict rules are written such that you have to equip ammunition *after* the bow or crossbow you're trying to load it into. Otherwise, you equip the ammo, then you equip the bow and it unequips the ammo for you. And of course you can't equip two quivers at once.

Ammunition also carries an "ammo type" flag which determines whether it can be loaded into a Bow ("Arrows" and "Quivers", type 0) or Crossbow ("Bolts", type 1).

## Armor

### Body Armor

Body Armor comes in a bunch of different "item types", like "Leather" and "Cuir Bouilli" and "Plate and Chain", but it doesn't make any difference to the game.

### Gloves

Technically, the Silver Gloves are "Mage Gloves" instead of "Gloves", but the distinction doesn't matter.

Everything listed on this table is a "Full Shield" except for the basic "Shield". Full Shields can't be used with Two-handers or Bows.

| Magic Shield (Phoebus)            |    10000    |  10  |  +4  |      |
| Dragon Shield                     |    12000    |  10  |  +5  |      |

No, it *doesn't* make any sense that Shields and Large Shields cost the same amount of gold. Thanks for asking.

## Shops

There are a handful of cities throughout Dilmun that have stores where you can buy, and more importantly sell, various items. They're listed here roughly in game order.

Most shops specialize in what goods they sell, but you can sell anything (with value) to any shop regardless. Prices listed are the purchase price; items sell for 50% of their purchase price. Most items have consistent pricing, with a couple of very notable exceptions (larger packs of Bolts in Mud Toad, Large Shields in Freeport).

As a side note, if a shop is broken up into departments (or if there are multiple stores in the same location) you'll usually find Dragon Stones under "Armor".

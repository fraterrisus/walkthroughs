# Tars Underground

![map](tars-underground.svg)

A tiny but confusing board, thanks to a spinner and a wrapping map. Your best bet is to get in and get out... although the easter egg is pretty epic.

This is a proper dungeon, so you need a light source to see and a compass to get your bearings. There are also far too many types of wandering monsters (1 in 100) for a board this small.

## Exits

(02,05) Stairs up to the ruins of [Tars](tars-ruins.md).

(00,05) A pit that you can *Climb* down to the [Underworld](magan-underworld.md), behind a secret door.

## Points of Interest

Whenever "your footsteps sound hollow", there's a secret door nearby. Face the wall and use *Tracker* to reveal it on the game map, or just walk through it.

**The Spinner (01,04):** A standard spinner trap, which works by changing your orientation but not redrawing the viewport (although if you have a compass spell running, it will point in the new orientation). Weirdly, if you wind up facing N or S, you are then able to walk through the wall!

**The Stone Arms (07,04):** Part of the Lanac'toor puzzle, stored in a chest behind a secret door. This is the only thing you really need to come here for, so take it and run.

**The Closet (04,07):** Another chest behind a secret door, this time with a **Healing Potion** (*S:Heal*) and five **Dragon Stones**.

**The Other Closet (04,00):** A locked chest (difficulty 1) behind a secret door. *H:Fire Light*, *D:Death Curse*, *S:Sun Stroke*.

**The Visual Illusion (05,02):** You spot yourself moving at the other end of an infinite corridor.

**The Adventuring Party (03,01):** Nasty.

**The Inexplicable Easter Egg (04,02):** Quite a shame about those adventurers, eh? Well, if you happen to use *Arcane Lore* here, Captain Kirk checks in from the bridge of the *Enterprise*:

> "The scanner reports a vessel approaching at warp 19!!"

> "Spock?", Kirk says, "Intentions?" Spock scans the intruder. "Unable to tell, it seems to be doing evasive manouvers as if it is under attack."

> Kirk looks over to the transport tube and sees a party just standing there completely bewildered. "Who are you?" are the last words said as the strange people vanish. "Illogical" says Spock.

This is hands-down the weirdest easter egg in the entire game. I screamed out loud, booted up an old save file, and ran to that spot to verify it for myself.

This repository contains walkthroughs that I've written for various computer role-playing games (CRPGs), mostly from the 1990s era of video gaming (i.e. my childhood). In the past I have posted these at various sites around the web, including GameFAQs, but the most up-to-date versions will always be kept here.

## Walkthroughs

- [Bard's Tale 1](bards-tale-1/): A full walkthrough with updated maps.
- [Deathlord](deathlord/): Highest-rated on GameFAQs before I stopped posting there.
- [Dragon Wars](dragon-wars): Extremely exhaustive and based on code decompilation.
- [Phantasie I](phantasie-1): A first version, partially accumulating from other walkthroughs.
- [Pool of Radiance](pool-of-radiance/walkthrough.txt): An older effort; not quite complete but pretty close.
- [Wasteland](wasteland): Complete and fairly comphrehensive, but in need of a rewrite.

## Recent Updates

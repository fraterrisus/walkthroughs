# Things and Stuff

## Weapons

All weapons conflict with each other, i.e. you can't wield an axe and a flail simultaneously, nor can you wield a sword and a crossbow. *Most* weapons don't conflict with shields.

### Two-Handed Weapons

| -------------------- | ----: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :------: | ----- |

| Spell Staff | 7000 | 1d10 | +5 | +8 | Low Magic 1 | |
| Mage Staff | 20000 | 1d20 | +10 | | | |

### Bows

Bows, like Two-handers, conflict with Full Shields but not regular Shields.

**Rate of Fire** is either one arrow, a burst (three), or auto-fire (entire quiver). You can't select higher rates of fire in `(Q)uickfight` mode.

| Item | Price | AV | Range | Rate | Requires |
| ---- | ----: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :-----: |
| Bow | 60 | | 20' | 1 | DEX 10 |
| Long Bow | 90 | +1 | 40' | 1 | DEX 14 |
| Great Bow | 310 | +2 | 50' | 1 | DEX 16 |
| Archer's Bow | 900 | +3 | 50' | 1 | DEX 18 |
| Magic Bow | 60 | +4 | 70' | 1 | DEX 10 |
| Gatlin Bow | 60 | | 20' | auto | DEX 10 |


### Crossbows

| Item | Price | AV | Range | Rate | Requires |
| ---- | ----: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :-----: |
| Crossbow | 60 | | 30' | 1 | DEX 12 |
| Tri-Cross | 600 | +1 | 30' | burst | DEX 15 |

### Guns
No, there aren't actually any guns in *Dragon Wars*; this is an easter egg. There's no corresponding weapon skill, either. But there sure is an "item type" in the code for it, along with one for "Ammo Clips" (as distinct from Ammunition, below).

### Ammunition

The item conflict rules are written such that you have to equip ammunition *after* the bow or crossbow you're trying to load it into. Otherwise, you equip the ammo, then you equip the bow and it unequips the ammo for you. And of course you can't equip two quivers at once.

Ammunition also carries an "ammo type" flag which determines whether it can be loaded into a Bow ("Arrows" and "Quivers", type 0) or Crossbow ("Bolts", type 1).

| Item         | Price|  Dmg | Other |
| ------------ | ----:| :--: | ----- |
| Arrow        |   50 |  1d6 | |
| White Arrow  |  150 |  1d8 | |
| Silver Arrow |  500 | 1d12 | |
| Grey Arrow   |   50 | 1d20 | |
| Magic Arrow  |  700 | 1d20 | |
| Magic Quiver |   50 |  1d4 | refills itself each round <!--{tr:.thick} -->
| Bolt, Bolts  |   60 |  1d4 | |
| Long Bolt    |   60 |  1d4 | +20' range |
| Pierce Bolt  | 1200 |  1d6 | +1 AV |
| Mega Bolt    |  600 | 1d20 | |
| Dead Bolt    |  600 | 1d20 | can be refilled with *S:Charger* |

### Thrown Weapons

| Item | Price | Dmg | AV | AC | Range | Requires | Other |

| Trident | 4000 | 2d20 | | | 40' | DEX 15 | returns to inventory after use |

## Armor

### Body Armor

Body Armor comes in a bunch of different "item types", like "Leather" and "Cuir Bouilli" and "Plate and Chain", but it doesn't make any difference to the game.

| Item | Price |  AC  |  AV  | Requires | Other |
| ---- | ----: | :--: | :--: | :------: | ----- |
| Cloth Armor | 25 | +1 | | | | 
| Pilgrim Garb | 20 | +1 | | | wear to pass Old Dock guards |
| Royal Robe | 2000 | +1 | | |
| Mage Cloth | 2500 | +3 | | Low Magic 1 | casts *L:Mage Light* |
| Leather Armor | 50 | +3 | –1 | | |
| Brigandine | 80 | +4 | –1 | | |
| Scale Armor | 250 | +6 | –2 | | |
| Chain Armor | 310 | +7 | –3 | | |
| Magic Chain | 6000 | +7 |  | | |
| Plate Mail | 3100 | +10 | –5 | | |
| Magic Plate | 50000 | +10 | –2 | | |
| Heavy Plate | 4000 | +12 | –6 | | |
| Dragon Plate | 3100 | +14 | –3 | | |

Some suits of Magic Chain will cast *M:Zak's Speed* if hit with *S:Charger*.

In Kingshome there's a suit of "Great Plate" that is the same as Heavy Plate, but it can't actually be found anywhere.

### Gloves

Technically, the Silver Gloves are "Mage Gloves" instead of "Gloves", but the distinction doesn't matter.

| Item          | Price |  AC  |  AV  |
| ------------- | ----: | :--: | :--: |
| Gauntlets     |  700  |  +2  | <!--{tr:.thick}-->
| Silver Gloves | 2000  |  +3  |      |

### Shields

Everything listed on this table is a "Full Shield" except for the basic "Shield". Full Shields can't be used with Two-handers or Bows.

| Item | Price | Requires | AC | AV |
| ---- | ----: | :------: | :-: | :-: |
| Shield | 1000 | STR 10 | +2 | <!--{tr:.thick}-->
| Fire Shield | 5000 | STR 12 | +2 | -2 |
| Large Shield | \*1000 | STR 12 | +3 | -2 |
| Magic Shield (Byzanople, College) | 3000 | STR 10 | +3 | |
| Magic Shield (Phoebus) | 1000 | STR 10 | +4 | |
| Dragon Shield | 12000 | STR 10 | +5 | |

Lots of things about shields don't make any sense:
- The Fire Shield has weapon statistics (1d12 at 40') but can't actually be used as a weapon.
- Shields (+2AC) cost the same as Large Shields (+3AC, -2AV).
- ...except in Freeport, where Large Shields cost 1/10 what they do anywhere else.
- The Fire Shield (+2AC, -2AV) is worse than every other shield, except in resale value.

### Helms

| Item | Price |  AC  |  AV  | Casts |
| ---- | :---: | :--: | :--: | ----- |
| Helm | 1000 | +1 | | |
| Gem Helm | 2000 | +2 | | |
| Black Helm | 3000 | +3 | | *M:Zak's Speed* |
| Dragon Helm | 7000 | +4 | –1 | |

### Boots

| Item         | Price |  AC  |  AV  |
| ------------ | :---: | :--: | :--: |
| Lucky Boots  | 2000  |  +1  |      |
| Golden Boots |   —   |  +2  |      |

### Rings

| Item | Price |  AC  |  AV  | Requires | Casts |
| ---- | :---: | :--: | :--: | :------: | ----- |
| The Ring | 1250 | +2 | +2 | | *H:Cloak Arcane* |
| Mage Ring | 2000 | +4 | +1 | Low Magic 3 | *D:Whirl Wind*\* |
| Magic Ring| — | +2 | +1 | | *D:Whirl Wind* |

\*: must be hit with *S:Charger* first

## Shops

There are a handful of cities throughout Dilmun that have stores where you can buy, and more importantly sell, various items. They're listed here roughly in game order.

Most shops specialize in what goods they sell, but you can sell anything (with value) to any shop regardless. Prices listed are the purchase price; items sell for 50% of their purchase price. Most items have consistent pricing, with a couple of very notable exceptions (larger packs of Bolts in Mud Toad, Large Shields in Freeport).

As a side note, if a shop is broken up into departments, or if there are multiple shops in the same location, you'll usually find Dragon Stones in the same place as armor.

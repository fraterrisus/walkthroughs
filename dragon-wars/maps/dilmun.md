# Dilmun

{% map-svg 'Dilmun' %}

The overworld map through which your party will adventure.

As a warning, you can't cast *D:Create Wall* here and I don't think there are any walls that you can usefully *D:Soften Stone*. Just in case you were tempted to try. Also, the map wraps, not that there's any way to actually go sailing over the water.

**Ambush (20,26):** The first time you step on this square, you're subdued by guards and thrown in the [Kingshome Dungeon](/dragon-wars/maps/kingshome-dungeon). This is also where the ferry master from the Snake Pit drops you, which may very well trigger the ambush if you haven't already.

**[Siege Camp](/dragon-wars/maps/siege-camp) (07,26)**, **[Byzanople](/dragon-wars/maps/byzanople) (07,27)**, and its dungeon. You can't enter Byzanople directly without going through the Siege Camp, even after the battle has been resolved.

The **[Old Dock](/dragon-wars/maps/old-dock) (14,17)** can be used to travel to the Lansk Undercity or the Pilgrim Dock.

**More Goblins (08,18):** These guys are just insult to injury; the fight regenerates, so if you try to exit the Bridge of Exiles to the E you hit them immediately.

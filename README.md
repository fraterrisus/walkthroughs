# README

This repository contains walkthroughs that I've written for various computer role-playing games (CRPGs), mostly from the 1990s era of video gaming (i.e. my childhood). In the past I have posted these at various sites around the web, including GameFAQs, but the most up-to-date versions will always be kept here.

Feel free to get in touch if you spot an error or have questions about anything, and happy gaming!
